# Lights Out Puzzle Game created with HTML, CSS, and JS
Lights Out is a classic puzzle game you can play at https://padasdaf.github.io/Lights-Out-Puzzle-Game/, where the goal is to turn off all the lights on a grid. The game starts with a grid of lights, some of which are turned on. Clicking on any light toggles its state (on/off) as well as the state of its adjacent lights (above, below, left, right). The challenge is to figure out the correct sequence of clicks to turn off all the lights on the board. Includes multiple grid sizes, difficulty levels, and a timed mode!
